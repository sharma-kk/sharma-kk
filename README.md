### Hi there 👋

My name is Kamal. I recently completed my PhD in Mathematics from the University of Hamburg. My doctoral research focused on the use of stochastic parameterization methods to quantify uncertainty arising from unresolved small-scale processes in geophysical fluid dynamics (GFD). Over the past couple of years, I have developed numerical solvers for various GFD equations—most notably, for a stochastic coupled ocean-atmosphere climate model.
